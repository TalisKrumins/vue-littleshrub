        description="A NCC Section J report, previously known as BCA Section J report, details the energy efficiency requirements of the National Construction Code (NCC). These are the regulations that need to be met for a given building to enable the building to progress through the approvals stages of a new building or significant renovation. These requirements are dependent on many attributes of the building in development, and the outcomes and requirements are unique to each building. While this might sound complicated, LittleShrub are experts in evaluating your building and letting you know how to meet these regulatory requirements in simple terms that are easily understood by the people required to use them.
      
        With NCC 2019 now in force in all states and territories, the thermal performance calculations of the thermal envelope now need to include the impact of thermal bridging within these reports. These calculations are more complicated that the ones previously required by NCC 2016 however are far more indicative of actual performance. LittleShrub were actively involved in the authoring of AS/NZS 4859.2 and are uniquely placed to provide guidance and expert solutions in this space.

        With intimate knowledge that only comes with being involved with developing the rules LittleShrub are uniquely placed to assist you in meeting the new Section J requirements of NCC 2019. Feel comfortable in the knowledge you are being assisted by true industry experts."

        title="Purpose"
        description="Put in the most simple terms; to reduce Australiaâ€™s energy consumption and output of greenhouse gas emissions. Australia, like most other developed nations of the world, understands one of the most effective strategies to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions is to improve the performance of their building stock.
      
        As the National Construction Code (NCC | BCA) is a body of rules and regulations that govern the requirements of how either a house or commercial building is built. Therefore it makes logical sense to include a set of rules in these documents that tell someone how to construct a building that is energy efficient. NCC Section J describes all the energy efficiency requirements that need to be met for a particular building."
